# caesar-cipher
First project using Ruby in the TOP curriculum

The objective here is to do a Caesar Cipher, which shifts all the characters of a string
an arbitrary number of characters up or down the alphabet.
I'm expected to be able to do it making use of what I learned about handling strings, arrays, and hashes.
